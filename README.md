### Project Title
US Bikeshare Analysis Tool

### Description
In this project, we can explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
-chicago.csv
-washington.csv
-new_york_city.csv
